# utl_program_banners
Create banners for your programs

    ```  Banners for your SAS programs using ASCII art  ```
    ```    ```
    ```  It might not be worth installing python and package pyfiglet,  ```
    ```  if you don't have plans to use python or any python packages.  ```
    ```    ```
    ```  Below are two banner command macros using 'programmers' SAS.  ```
    ```  The full functionality is not available in EE, UE, EG or SAS Studio.  ```
    ```  You may be able to get this to work in EE, but some of the other 30  ```
    ```  or so command macros will not work in EE.  ```
    ```    ```
    ```  If you have the 'old text editor' available you should be  ```
    ```  able to use the code below.  ```
    ```    ```
    ```  *          _       _   _                _  ```
    ```   ___  ___ | |_   _| |_(_) ___  _ __    / |  ```
    ```  / __|/ _ \| | | | | __| |/ _ \| '_ \   | |  ```
    ```  \__ \ (_) | | |_| | |_| | (_) | | | |  | |  ```
    ```  |___/\___/|_|\__,_|\__|_|\___/|_| |_|  |_|  ```
    ```    ```
    ```  ;  ```
    ```    ```
    ```  Solution 1 (Proc explode only upper case is supported and I use lower case for spacing)  ```
